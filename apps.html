    <h4>Bible Reading Plans That Never Leave You Behind</h4>
    <p>You have tried before using one of the "in a year" programs only to find after the first few weeks you are already "behind." Soon, a "few days behind" becomes a "few weeks behind." Before long you just give up and decide to wait until next January to start again!</p>

    <h4>Christian Q & A</h4>
    <p>While never meant to be a substitute for the Bible, catechisms can be a useful tool in learning and understanding church doctrine. Presenting doctrine as a series of questions and answers helps by breaking sometimes difficult and challenging theology into more managable pieces. It also provides a fun and challenging way to grow in your understanding of God and the Scriptures.</p>
