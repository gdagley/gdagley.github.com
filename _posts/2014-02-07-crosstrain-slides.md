I had the privilege of speaking at the [Crosstrain Morning](http://crosstrainevents.com/) in January.  It was excellently organized by [Philip Likens](https://twitter.com/philiplikens) and if you have a chance to go to one in the future, you should!  It is a great concept: "a diverse gathering of T-shaped people* sharing ideas to drive empathy and knowledge across disciplines"

The topic for the morning was Failure, "because so much learning can come from telling the stories of our collective failures. Whether that failure is product-related, service-related, inter-personal, financial, or otherwise, we can learn from the mistakes of those in our field and outside it."

Here are my [slides from Failing With Friends](/assets/Crosstrain_2013_12_06.pdf)
