Last night I recieved my very own copy of <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1365064">"Nobody Knows Shoes"</a> by <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">why the lucky stiff</a>.  <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/">Shoes</a>, in case you are wondering, is a small framework for writing GUI applications that can run on multiple OS's (Windows, Mac, Linux).  <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1365064">"Nobody Knows Shoes"</a> is the API documentation for the framework presented in the form of... well... comic book/ short stories/ examples... and that doesn't even do it justice.  I played around with Shoes and decided to get the book to see what it was all about.  It is well worth the cost (less than $15, including shipping), if not for the pure entertainment value.  It is also a good reference, as well.

If you haven't experienced why or <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net">any of his code</a>, you should definitely take a look.  You will be entertained and <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/">enlightened</a>.
