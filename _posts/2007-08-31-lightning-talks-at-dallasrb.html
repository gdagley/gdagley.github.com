We are doing lightning talks at this month's <a href="http://www.dallasrb.org">dallas.rb</a> meeting.  I decided to give the group some choice of what I would present.

I will do a short one on "Why Firefox Makes Me Look Good" or "Better Web App Development using Firefox and a <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=511287">Buttload</a> of Extensions"

I can also do one "JQuery: <a href="http://www.free-lyrics.org/Aaron-Neville/4605-Dont-Know-Much.html">I Don't Know Much, But I Know I Love You</a> "

And since neither of those are Ruby related, I will throw another one out there: "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpvyhGnF9_E">Tighter Abs</a>: XML Situps Made Easy With Ruby" 

I'll let everyone decide which ones you want to hear more about.

<strong>Update</strong>

I only did the JQuery presentation and <a href='http://www.mckinneystation.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/jquery.pdf' title='JQuery Presentation'>here are the slides</a> (although they were much more interesting in person).
