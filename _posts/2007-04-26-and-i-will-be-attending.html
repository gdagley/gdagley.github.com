I am going to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf next month</a> in Portland.  Of course, up until today, I didn't know what sessions I would be attending.  But <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/04/26/introducing-myconfplan/">Dr Nic fixed all that</a> for me with a great application.

Check out <a href="http://myconfplan.com/conferences/RailsConf2007/users/gdagley">the RailsConf schedule and see where I'll be</a>.
