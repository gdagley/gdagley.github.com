I got in late last night to Portland.  DFW --> LAX --> PDX  Of course, it was really late considering the 2 hour time difference it was REALLY late.  1:00 AM lPDT ate.  (or 3:00 AM CDT late) But my body didn't take that into account when it decided to wake up at 7:30 AM CDT (or 5:30 AM PDT).  So I am off to the conference to get some coffee.  Lots o' coffee.
