After <a href="http://www.mckinneystation.com/2007/05/08/and-that-is-why-you-have-backups/">my last post</a>, I thought I would share what I use for developing on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>.

<h2>Editor</h2>
I have always been a hands-on kinda guy, so I don't use any of the <a href="http://www.aptana.com/">fancy</a> <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html">IDEs</a>.  Right now, I am using <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html">SciTE</a> for two reasons.  It feels lightweight and it is available for Linux and Windows.  Since <a href="http://www.averatec.com/products/portable/thinlight/3200Series.asp">my laptop</a> does not have a lot of memory, a lightweight editor is a must.  I tried <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, but it chewed up all my memory and slowed things to a crawl.  So SciTE with <a href="http://caladbolg.net/scite.php">some additional plugins</a> (and <a href="http://mondaybynoon.com/2007/03/12/using-scite-with-textmate-style-snippets/">information on getting them going</a>) powers <a href="http://www.mckinneystation.com/projects">the development at McKinney Station</a>.

<h2>Ruby and Rails</h2>

I am using the latest <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> for all new development.  For testing I am using <a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org">RSpec</a>, which seems <a href="http://www.mckinneystation.com/2007/04/25/specify-first-test-last-if-ever/">a lot more intuitive to me</a>.  Other <a href="http://rubygems.org/">gems</a> I  have installed include:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://fastercsv.rubyforge.org/">FasterCSV</a> - parsing CSV files</li>
  <li><a href="http://tech.rufy.com/2006/08/mapreduce-for-ruby-ridiculously-easy.html">starfish</a> - simple Ruby Map/Reduce</li>
  <li><a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">mongrel</a> - lightweight Ruby web server</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/">hpricot</a> - Ruby HTML parser</li>
</ul>

<h2>Database</h2>

I love starting all of my development projects with SQLite.  It is <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoUseSQLite">so easy to get up and running</a>.   As the project matures, I am able to quickly switch development over to a MySQL database with a change in the application's database configuration and a quick <code>rake db:migrate</code>.

<h2>Version Control</h2>

All source code versioning is done with Subversion.  With <a href="http://www.railsonwave.com/railsonwave/2006/12/19/smart-subversion-script-for-rails-projects">this quick little script</a>, I can get a Rails project committed and started in minutes.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I am always looking for ways to speed up my development process, but so far this is working for me.  And it is very enjoyable.
