With one of my recent <a href="/2008/06/03/microapps-encourage-hacking/">microapps</a>, <a href="http://www.unscientificpolls.com">UnscientificPolls.com</a>, I wanted to show the polling data in more interesting ways than just the vote counts.  Charting was the logical conclusion, but how do it was a more difficult decision.

Some of the criteria I had for choosing the charting solution included: ease of use (it is  microapp, of course), compatible with shared hosting environment, fast, easy to customize.

Some of the libraries I looked at included: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">flot with jquery</a>, <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff">gruff</a>, <a href="http://scruffy.rubyforge.org/">scruffy</a>, <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/pages/sparklines">sparklines</a>, and <a href="http://googlecharts.rubyforge.org/">googlecharts</a>.  I settled on the googlecharts library because I didn't need the interactive features of <code>flot</code> and I didn't want to worry about RMagick needed for <code>gruff</code>, <code>scruffy</code>, or <code>sparklines</code>. 

<h2>Google Charts API</h2>

The <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart">Google Charts API</a> is an interesting tool that lets you dynamically generate charts using a "simple" URL scheme.   The usage policy is very generous too: "There's no limit to the number of calls per day you can make to the Google Chart API."

This would allow me to offload the image generation to Google (who supposedly has quite a bit of computing power) and let my application, in a shared hosting environment, focus on collecting votes.

<h2>Enter <em>googlecharts</em></h2>

The challenge with the Google Charts API "simple" url scheme is that it would very tedious to have generate it by concatenating the strings together.  Fortunately, Matt Aimonetti built the <code>googlecharts</code> gem for Ruby.  You can get it from <a href="http://www.rubyforge.org">Rubyforge</a> (<code>gem install googlecharts</code>) or <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> (<code>gem install mattetti-googlecharts</code>).  

<h2>Installing <em>googlecharts</em> in my Rails App</h2>

With <code>googlecharts</code> installed on my machine I could start using it, by adding it to my <code>config/environment.rb</code> file.

<pre>
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.gem "googlecharts", :lib => "gchart"
end
</pre>

Since the file we need to include is named "gchart", not "googlecharts", we have to specify the <code>:lib => "gchart"</code> option.

I also didn't want to worry about installing in on the deployment machine, so I unpacked it to the <code>vendor/gems</code> folder using <code>rake gems:unpack</code>.

<h2>Now to the Charts</h2>

Once all that was in place the challenge was getting the data into a format that would be easy to pass to the library.  It turns out, that wasn't too challenging either.

<h3>The Helper</h3>

In my view helper module I created a method that would collect the data needed for the chart.

<pre>
  def pie_chart poll
    @pie_chart ||= {
      :data => poll.choices.collect(&:votes_count),
      :colors => poll.choices.collect {|c| c.winner? ? "264409" : "8A1F11" }
    }
  end
</pre>

This just loops over the choices and collects the needed data and puts it in an easy to use Hash.

<h3>The View</h3>

<pre>
    <%= Gchart.pie :size => '240x160', 
                   :title => 'Vote split',
                   :data => pie_chart(@poll)[:data],
                   :bar_colors => pie_chart(@poll)[:colors],
                   :format => 'image_tag' %>
</pre>

Using googlecharts Gchart made it easy to build the "simple" url needed for a pie chart using the Google Charts API (also supports line, scatter, venn, sparklines, and meter charts)  I didn't even have to add the <img /> tag because I could pass the <code>:format => 'image_tag'</code> and one was generated for me.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I was extremely happy with how quick and easy it was to get some simple charts into my application (check them out at <a href="http://www.unscientificpolls.com">UnscientificPolls.com</a>).  The response time from Google seems to be as fast as if the images were stored locally. It also saved me the headache of installing with RMagick.  This is definitely a good fit for simple graphs and charts in a Rails application.
