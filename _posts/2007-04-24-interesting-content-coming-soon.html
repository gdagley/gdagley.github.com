It finally happened.  McKinney Station got a blog!  Right now there is not much here, but should be changing very soon.  I have all sorts of articles in my head wanting, no, demanding to get out.  Thoughts on web applications, Ruby, Rails, Java, xHTML, CSS, JavaScript and more.

Check back soon for my latest thoughts and ideas.  Welcome to the Station, this train is about the leave.
