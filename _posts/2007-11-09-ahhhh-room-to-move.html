I got a Dell 2007WFP Ultrasharp 20" LCD monitor this week using <a href="http://www.binalert.com">BINalert.com</a>.  

First, about the monitor and setup.  It is a great monitor, nice and bright!  My friend, Matt, encouraged me to spend a little more and get the Ultrasharp.  I am glad I did (although I didn't pay much more, see below).  I REALLY love the portrait mode.  In the picture I have <a href="http://www.mailplaneapp.com">Mailplane</a>, <a href="http://www.karppinen.fi/pyro/">Pyro</a>, <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>, and <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a> all stacked nicely.  And it doesn't feel crowded.  I use <a href="http://virtuedesktops.info/">VirtueDesktops</a> and  keep all my work on the another virtual desktop.  On the "work" desktop I put <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> and can see lots of lines of code.  Plus I still have room to keep open console windows at the bottom to see <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/">autotest results</a>, server logs, etc.  My browser can stay open on the laptop for easy inspection of whatever I am developing.

Now about <a href="http://www.binalert.com">BINalert.com</a>.  (Disclosure: I built this site with a friend and I do make money with it.)  BINalert lets you setup up alerts so you can get notifications on new Buy-It-Now auctions on eBay.  There are lots of items listed with Buy-It-Now prices that are REALLY good deals.  For example, this monitor.  I setup an alert to watch for Dell 2007WFP Ultrasharp monitors with a Buy-It-Now price of $250 or less.  As soon as this one was listed, I got an email letting me know.  I went and checked it out (it was used but in great condition), and a week later I have my new monitor (or at least it's new to me).  And I saved about $150 in the process.
