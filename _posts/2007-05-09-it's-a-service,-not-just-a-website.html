When developing the <a href="http://www.catechizeme.com">CatechizeMe</a> website, I realized that there was so much more that could be done with the data that was being provided.  Now I know that catechism questions are not dynamic and changing 5 times a second, but they would still be a good testing ground for developing an API.  The API would allow other developers access to the data to come up with their own creations.

So I started thinking of how much this applies to other applications out there.
