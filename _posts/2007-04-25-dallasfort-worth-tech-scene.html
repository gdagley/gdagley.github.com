I went to the <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampDallas2">Dallas DemoCamp2</a> on Monday night to check out some of the latest offerings from North Texas entrepreneurs.  And there was quite a showing with 6 presentations and at least 25 people in attendance.

What I love about DemoCamp is the format.   You get 15 minutes for the entire presentation.   And that is broken down into 10 minutes for for the demonstration and 5 minutes for questions and answers.  With this format you aren't intimidated by amount of time to fill.  Almost anyone can talk for 10 minutes about their project that is the "next big thing."
