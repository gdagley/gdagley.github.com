I have come across a few useful sites the are helping to connect other Rails developers with each other.  Some are specific to RailsConf while others are targeted at Rails developers.

<h2>RailsConf</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://myconfplan.com/conferences/RailsConf2007/">MyConfPlan</a> - Plan which sessions you will be going to.  <a href="http://myconfplan.com/conferences/RailsConf2007/users/gdagley">Here's my schedule</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://railsconf2007.conferencemeetup.com/">ConferenceMeetup</a> - Meet up with others while at RailsConf.  <a href="http://railsconf2007.conferencemeetup.com/p/378-geoffrey-dagley">Want to me up with me?</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Entrepreneurial</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://workingwithrails.com/">Working With Rails</a> - Find and recommend others who are working with Rails.  You can <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/person/2612-geoffrey-dagley">see what I am doing</a> and even <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/recommendation/new/person/2612-geoffrey-dagley">recommend me</a> if you want.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.railsforall.org">Rails For All</a> - Promoting Rails to the world.  <a href="http://www.railsforall.org/independent_developers/55">And helping freelance developers get their name out there.</a> </li>
</ul>
