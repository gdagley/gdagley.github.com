After a few years of a very boring layout for the McKinney Station website, I have added a few items in the sidebar to show that I actually do things around here.  It's not much, but it is a start.  You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/gdagley">Twitter</a>, check out my projects on <a href="http://github.com/gdagley">Github</a> and <a href="http://rubyforge.org/users/gdagley/">RubyForge</a>, and see what I am reading on <a href="http://delicious.com/gdagley">del.icio.us</a>. 

Hopefully this gives a little insight into what I do.
