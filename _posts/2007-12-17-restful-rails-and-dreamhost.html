I recently upgraded <a href="http://www.stagingtracks.com">StagingTracks.com</a> to use <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done">Rails 2.0</a>.  I was excited about so many of the newest features that it seemed the logical thing to do.  I even decided to upgrade <a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org">RSpec</a> in the process so I would be able to play with <a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2007/12/14/rspec-1-1">some of the new features</a> there too.  

Unfortunately, despite extensive local spec'ing, when I <a href="http://capify.org/">deployed the app</a> to Dreamhost, <a href="http://www.stagingtracks.com/posts/view/a_minor_glitch">things did not go as planned</a>.  I was using <a href="http://piston.rubyforge.org/">piston to manage my Rails in the app and all of my plugins</a>, so I didn't need to worry about which gems were installed on the server.  What I found was that when users tried to submit new information using the forms on the site, nothing would happen.  Let me correct that: It would look like something happened, but no data was submitted.

<h2>So what was the problem?</h2>

I first started by watching the <code>production.log</code> to see if the data was even getting submitted.  As expected, nothing was coming through.  I then used the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/966">Tamper Data plugin</a> for Firefox to see if I if the data was getting out of the browser.  It was, but something interesting appeared.  I saw a 301 Redirect when the page was submitted.  Odd.  Especially since the application wasn't seeing the data and there were no redirects in the production.log.  

So I started looking in the http <code>access.log</code> to see why the data wasn't coming through to the app.  What I saw was surprising:

<pre>- - [16/Dec/2007:19:24:30 -0800] "POST /shops HTTP/1.1" 301 591 "http://www.stagingtracks.com/shops/new" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11"
- - [16/Dec/2007:19:24:30 -0800] "GET /shops/ HTTP/1.1" 200 319 "http://www.stagingtracks.com/shops/new" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11"</pre>

It looked like the POST (which goes to the 'create' method using Rails RESTful approach) was being redirected to '/shops/'.  The browser would then call '/shops/ ' with a GET (which is the 'index' action).  And the form submission never got through.  Now I was perplexed.  Why would the web server being sending the 301 Redirect?

It became a little clearer when I saw this in the logs as well:

<pre>- - [16/Dec/2007:19:15:11 -0800] "GET /shops HTTP/1.1" 301 591 "http://www.stagingtracks.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11"
- - [16/Dec/2007:19:15:11 -0800] "GET /shops/ HTTP/1.1" 200 89174 "http://www.stagingtracks.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11"</pre>

For some reason, the web server was causing 301 Redirects when the trailing slash was missing!  Now I had heard of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=trailing+slash+rails">the trailing slash problem</a>, but couldn't find a suitable solution that would be easy to implement.

<h2>So How Do You Fix It?</h2>

I am so glad I am surrounded by lots of smart people.  A quick conversation with my friend <a href="http://robsanheim.com/">Rob Sanheim</a> turned up <a href="http://mephisto.stikipad.com/help/show/Developer+Tips">the solution</a>.  

I added the following to my <code>.htaccess</code> file:

<pre>DirectorySlash Off</pre>

I added it after the <code>Options +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI</code> and before the <code>RewriteEngine On</code>

Now things are back to normal again.  I am now able to get back to <a href="http://www.stagingtracks.com">connecting model railroaders</a>.
