I recently had a spike in traffic (1-2 visits/day to 30-40 visits/day) over at <a href="http://www.catechizeme.com">CatechizeMe.com</a>.  Someone out on the internet came across it, found it useful, and linked to it.  Yay!

With this new traffic, came some new requests for features.  The first was a request for a <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/directory">Google Gadget</a>.  I didn't know much about what I needed to create a Gadget, but after <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/index.html">looking it up</a> I realized I could use the <a href="http://www.catechizeme.com/resources/catechizeme-api">CatechizeMe API</a> that came automatically when I built the app.  With just a few lines of code, the Daily Question service was created and returning JSON data.  You gotta love it when things are this easy.

BEFORE:

<pre>
  def daily_question
    @question = @catechism.daily_question
    render :template => '/questions/show'
  end
</pre>

AFTER:
<pre>
  def daily_question
    @question = @catechism.daily_question
    respond_to do |wants|
      wants.html { render :template => '/questions/show' }
      wants.js { render_json @question.to_json }
    end
  end
</pre>

So now I get a <a href="http://www.catechizeme.com/catechisms/westminster_shorter_catechism/daily_question">daily catechism question from the CatechizeMe website</a> or via the Google Gadget using JSON:
