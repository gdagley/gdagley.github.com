I have been meaning to link to some of the talks I have done over the past year.  So here you go:

## Scaling With Friends

#### [Big Ruby 2013](http://www.bigrubyconf.com/) - [video](http://confreaks.com/videos/2307-bigruby2013-scaling-with-friends)

What started with two brothers in the McKinney Public Library is now a world wide word phenomenon on multiple mobile platforms. Weâ€™ll look at how we have grown, the mistakes we made, and the changes we have made along the way:

* Serving millions of players a day: Stats, stats, stats!
* Working with constraints:
  * 1 service, 6 games (and counting)
  * Native clients means backward compatibility, ftw!
* How do I know what to fix?
* Instrumenting and reporting on everything Where is the data?
* Using the database, memcache, Redis to the fullest
* What we did wrong? What we did right? What would we do differently?

## Mobile Omakase

#### [Dallas.rb](http://www.dallasrb.org) - [slides](http://geoffreydagley.com/dallasrb_20131105)

Mobile development is complicated. To be a successful soloist, you must start with the simplest possible tools that will allow you to complete the task at hand. Using [Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape) makes building APIs for web services simple and is tailored for creating web APIs in Ruby. [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) takes the ceremony out of building iOS applications with Obj-C and lets you focus on building out the app in a language you love.

We will take a look at both of these tools, discuss the benefits, challenges, and ways to improve (and shorten) our development lifecyle with things like specs (for client and server), API documentation via [fdoc](https://github.com/square/fdoc), and incorporating existing Obj-C libraries with [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/).
