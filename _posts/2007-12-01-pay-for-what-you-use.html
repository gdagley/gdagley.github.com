My friend, Chris Gay, is a finalist in the <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/amazon_startupchallenge.jsp">Amazon Web Services Startup Challenge</a> with his company, <a href="http://www.milemeter.com">MileMeter</a>.  I love the concept of only paying for the auto insurance I am going to use.  Both my wife and I work out of the home and therefore our cars sit in the garage alot.  But I still have to pay the same rates as my neighbors who drive to downtown Dallas everyday.  For both cars!  

So now I urge you to <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/amazon_startupchallenge.jsp">go and vote for Chris and MileMeter</a>.
