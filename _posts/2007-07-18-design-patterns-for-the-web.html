I came across the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/index.php">Yahoo! Developer Network: Design Pattern Library</a> recently and was impressed with the number of patterns they had.  It has been out for a while now, but I am just now getting back to checking it out.  Definitely a useful resource.
