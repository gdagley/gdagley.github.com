Last week, my laptop started acting funny.  Not that unusual since I run <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> on <a href="http://www.averatec.com/products/portable/thinlight/3200Series.asp">my laptop</a>. It's not <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">one of the super computers</a> all <a href="http://www.meme-rocket.com/">my</a> <a href="http://mvm.therealadam.com/">buddies</a> have, but it does let me <a href="http://www.mckinneystation.com/projects">get the job done</a>.  

So last week when things finally got to a tipping point, I decided to try an upgrade to the latest Ubuntu release.  Needless to say, it didn't go as planned.  With a planned trip coming up, I needed to get things back in order quickly.  I made sure I had a current backup of my /home directory, and did a brand new install.  Things went mostly well (remember this is a laptop) and within a day I was back up and going.

For my own reference later, these are the things I had to do to get Ubuntu working on my Averatec.

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/48263">Add boot setting to enable wired network</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.averatec.com/customercare/downloads.asp">Download Broadcom 43xx drivers for wireless network.</a></li>
  <li>Use ndiswrapper and blacklist broadcom drivers (<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=187316&page=2">see last post by codyjack</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="http://johnny.chadda.se/2007/02/21/unlock-the-gnome-keyring-upon-login/">Unlock the keyring automatically when logging in to quickly connect to wireless networks</a>.</li>
  <li>Restore backup</li>
  <li>Get back to work</li>
</ul>
